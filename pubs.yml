        title: A Case Study of First Person Aiming at Low Latency for Esports
        conference: Esports and High-Performance Human-Computer Interaction Workshop

        abstract: "Lower computer system input-to-output latency substantially re-duces many task completion times. In fact, literature shows that reduction in targeting task completion time from decreased latency often exceeds the decrease in latency alone. However, for aiming in first person shooter (FPS) games, some prior work has demonstrated diminishing returns below 40 ms of local input-to-output computer system latency. In this paper, we review this prior art and provide an additional case study with data demonstrating the importance of local system latency improvement, even at latency values below 20 ms. Though other factors may determine victory in a particular esports challenge, ensuring balanced local computer latency among competitors is essential to fair competition."

        abstract: 'We contribute several practical extensions to the probe-based irradiance-field-with-visibility representation [Majercik et al. 2019] [McGuire et al. 2017] to improve image quality, constant and asymptotic performance, memory efficiency, and artist control. We developed these extensions in the process of incorporating the previous work into the global illumination solutions of the NVIDIA RTXGI SDK, the Unity and Unreal Engine 4 game engines, and proprietary engines for several commercial games. These extensions include: an intuitive tuning parameter (the "self-shadow" bias); heuristics to speed transitions in the global illumination; reuse of irradiance data as prefiltered radiance for recursive glossy reflection; a probe state machine to prune work that will not affect the final image; and multiresolution cascaded volumes for large worlds.'

        abstract: "End-to-end latency in remote-rendering systems can reduce user task performance. This notably includes aiming tasks on game streaming services, which are presently below the standards of competitive first-person desktop gaming. We evaluate the latency-induced penalty on task completion time in a controlled environment and show that it can be significantly mitigated by adopting and modifying image and simulation-warping techniques from virtual reality, eliminating up to 80% of the penalty from 80 ms of added latency. This has potential to enable remote rendering for esports and increase the effectiveness of remote-rendered content creation and robotic teleoperation. We provide full experimental methodology, analysis, implementation details, and source code."

        abstract: "Emergent in the field of head mounted display design is a desire to leverage the limitations of the human visual system to reduce the computation, communication, and display workload in power and form-factor constrained systems. Fundamental to this reduced workload is the ability to match display resolution to the acuity of the human visual system, along with a resulting need to follow the gaze of the eye as it moves, a process referred to as foveation. A display that moves its content along with the eye may be called a Foveated Display, though this term is also commonly used to describe displays with non-uniform resolution that attempt to mimic human visual acuity. We therefore recommend a definition for the term Foveated Display that accepts both of these interpretations. Furthermore, we include a simplified model for human visual Acuity Distribution Functions (ADFs) at various levels of visual acuity, across wide fields of view and propose comparison of this ADF with the Resolution Distribution Function of a foveated display for evaluation of its resolution at a particular gaze direction. We also provide a taxonomy to allow the field to meaningfully compare and contrast various aspects of foveated displays in a display and optical technology-agnostic manner."

        abstract: "In competitive sports, human performance makes the difference between who wins and loses. In some competitive video games (esports), response time is an essential factor of human performance. When the athlete's equipment (computer, input and output device) responds with lower latency, it provides a measurable advantage. In this study, we isolate latency and refresh rate by artificially increasing latency when operating at high refresh rates. Eight skilled esports athletes then perform gaming-inspired first person targeting tasks under varying conditions of refresh rate and latency, completing the tasks as quickly as possible. We show that reduced latency has a clear benefit in task completion time while increased refresh rate has relatively minor effects on performance when the inherent latency reduction present at high refresh rates is removed. Additionally, for certain tracking tasks, there is a small, but marginally significant effect from high refresh rates alone."

        abstract: "This article presents a machine learning approach to map outputs from an embedded array of sensors distributed throughout a deformable body to continuous and discrete virtual states, and its application to interpret human touch in soft interfaces. We integrate stretchable capacitors into a rubber membrane, and use a passive addressing scheme to probe sensor arrays in real time. To process the signals from this array, we feed capacitor measurements into convolutional neural networks that classify and localize touch events on the interface. We implement this concept with a device called OrbTouch. To modularize the system, we use a supervised learning approach wherein a user defines a set of touch inputs and trains the interface by giving it examples; we demonstrate this by using OrbTouch to play the popular game Tetris. Our regression model localizes touches with mean test error of 0.09â€‰mm, whereas our classifier recognizes five gestures with a mean test error of 1.2%. In a separate demonstration, we show that OrbTouch can discriminate between 10 different users with a mean test error of 2.4%. At test time, we feed the outputs of these models into a debouncing algorithm to provide a nearly error-free experience."

        abstract: "We present a near-eye augmented reality display with resolution and focal depth dynamically driven by gaze tracking. The display combines a traveling microdisplay relayed off a concave half-mirror magnifier for the high-resolution foveal region, with a wide field-of-view peripheral display using a projector-based Maxwellian-view display whose nodal point is translated to follow the viewer's pupil during eye movements using a traveling holographic optical element.  The same optics relay an image of the eye to an infrared camera used for gaze tracking, which in turn drives the foveal display location and peripheral nodal point. Our display supports accommodation cues by varying the focal depth of the microdisplay in the foveal region, and by rendering simulated defocus on the 'always in focus' scanning laser projector used for peripheral display. The resulting family of displays significantly improves on the field-of-view, resolution, and form-factor tradeoff present in previous augmented reality designs.  We show prototypes supporting 30, 40 and 60 cpd foveal resolution at a net 85x78 degree field of view per eye."

        abstract: "We present a technique for real-time ray tracing with the goal of reaching 240 frames per second or more. The core idea is to trade spatial resolution for faster temporal updates in such a way that the display and human visual system aid in integrating high-quality images. We use a combination of frameless and interleaved rendering concepts together with ideas from temporal antialiasing algorithms and novel building blocks---the major one being adaptive selection of pixel orderings within tiles, which reduces spatiotemporal aliasing significantly. The image quality is verified with a user study. Our work can be used for esports or any kind of rendering where higher frame rates are needed."

        abstract: "We present a new image dataset generated by the NVIDIA Deep Learning Data Synthesizer intended for use in object detection, pose estimation, and tracking applications. This dataset contains 144k stereo image pairs generated from 18 camera view points of three photorealistic virtual environments with up to 10 objects (chosen randomly from the 21 object models of the YCB dataset) and flying distractors.  Object and camera pose, scene lighting, and quantity of objects and distractors were randomized. Each provided view includes RGB, depth, segmentation, and surface normal images. We describe our approach for domain randomization and provide insight into the decisions that produced the dataset."

        abstract: "Virtual reality experiences via immersive optics and sound are becoming ubiquitous; there are several consumer systems (e.g., Oculus Rift and HTC Vive) now available with these capabilities. Other sensory experiences, such as that of touch remain elusive in this field. The most successful examples of haptic sensation (e.g., Nintendo 64's rumble pack and its descendants) are vibrotactile, which do not afford for persistent, morphological shape experiences. This letter presents work on the development of a 12 DOF fluidically pressurized soft actuator for persistent and kinesthetic haptic sensations, a hardware controller for operating it, and software interface with NVIDIA's game VR Funhouse."

        abstract: We introduce a pragmatic algorithm for real-time adaptive supersampling in games. It extends temporal antialiasing of rasterized images with adaptive ray tracing, and conforms to the constraints of a commercial game engine and today's GPU ray tracing APIs. The algorithm removes blurring and ghosting artifacts associated with standard temporal antialiasing and achieves quality approaching 8X supersampling of geometry, shading, and materials while staying within the 33ms frame budget required of most games.

        abstract: "SimTRaX is a simulation infrastructure for simultaneous exploration of highly parallel accelerator architectures and how applications map to them. The infrastructure targets both cycle-accurate and functional simulation of architectures with thousands of simple cores that may share expensive computation and memory resources. A modified LLVM backend used to compile C++ programs for the simulated architecture allows the user to create custom instructions that access proposed special-purpose hardware and to debug and profile the applications being executed. The simulator models a full memory hierarchy including registers, local scratchpad RAM, shared caches, external memory channels, and DRAM main memory, leveraging the USIMM DRAM simulator to provide accurate dynamic latencies and power usage. SimTRaX provides a powerful and flexible infrastructure for exploring a class of extremely parallel architectures for parallel applications that are not easily simulated using existing simulators."

        abstract: "This paper presents an entirely compliant controller handle for use in virtual and augmented reality environments. The controller handle transitions between two static states: a semi-rigid, large diameter state when pneumatically pressurized and a soft, compressible, smaller diameter state when depressurized. We integrated the controller with a modified version of NVIDIAâ€™s VR Funhouse employing the two controller states to simulate the physical feel of two virtual objects. We used finite element modeling to downselect an internal elastomer lattice within the controller that controls deformation upon inflation. Finally, we show an example of using the compliance of the handle as an interaction input by designing an algorithm to identify rapid compressions of the handle as a signal to swap objects in the virtual environment."

        abstract: In this chapter, we discuss a pragmatic approach to real-time supersampling that extends commonly used temporal antialiasing techniques with adaptive ray tracing. The algorithm conforms to the constraints of a commercial game engine, removes blurring and ghosting artifacts associated with standard temporal antialiasing, and achieves quality approaching 16x supersampling of geometry, shading, and materials within the 16 ms frame budget required of most games.

        abstract: Latency can make all the difference in competitive online games. Late warp is a class of techniques used in VR that can reduce latency in FPS games as well. Prior art has demonstrated these techniques can recover most of the player performance lost to computer or network latency. Inspired by prior work demonstrating the usefulness of late warp as a potential solution to FPS latency, we provide an interactive demonstration, playable in a web browser, that shows how much latency limits aiming performance, and how late warp can help.

        abstract: "In this installation, we demonstrate two novel wearable augmented reality (AR) prototypes inspired by the understandings on human visual system: Prescription AR and Foveated AR. Prescription AR is a 5mm-thick prescription-embedded AR display based on a free-form image combiner. A plastic prescription lens corrects viewer's vision while a half-mirror-coated free-form image combiner located delivers an augmented image located at the fixed focal depth (1 m). Foveated AR is a near-eye AR display with resolution and focal depth dynamically driven by gaze tracking. The display combines a traveling microdisplay relayed off a concave half-mirror magnifier for the high-resolution foveal region, with a wide FOV peripheral display using a projector-based Maxwellian-view display whose nodal point is translated to follow the viewer's pupil during eye movements using a traveling holographic optical element (HOE). The same optics relay an image of the eye to an infrared camera used for gaze tracking, which in turn drives the foveal display location and peripheral nodal point. Our display supports accommodation cues by varying the focal depth of the microdisplay in the foveal region, and by rendering simulated defocus on the 'always in focus' scanning laser projector used for peripheral display."

        abstract: Augmented reality (AR) has recently gained momentum in the form of a variety of available optical see-through near-eye displays (NEDs) such as the Meta 2and the Microsoft Hololens. These devices are a big step forward towards Sutherland's vision of an ultimate display [Sutherland 1968]. The device we demonstrate attempts to deal with the main limitations of current devices. First, the graphics images are at a constant virtual distance for the eyes' accommodation mechanism, while the vergence of the two eyes working in concert places the virtual object(s) at a distance other than the accommodation distance. This vergence-accommodation conflict is one of the main problems in many AR and VR systems [Kress and Starner 2013]. The second limitation is achieving a wide FOV with compact optics. Cakmakci et al. [2006] contend that achieving a wide field-of-view (FOV) is the major optical design challenge in AR NEDs.

        abstract: There is not yet consensus in the field on what constitutes a ``foveated display''. We propose a compromise between the perspectives of rendering, imaging, physiology and vision science that defines a foveated display as a display designed to function in the context of user gaze. This definition enables us to describe 2 axes of foveation, gaze interaction and resolution distribution, which we then subdivide to provide useful categories for classification. We view this proposal as the start of a discussion among the community rather than a final taxonomy.

        abstract: "This dissertation presents computer architecture designs that are efficient for ray tracing based rendering algorithms. The primary observation is that ray tracing maps better to independent thread issue hardware designs than it does to dependent thread and data designs used in most commercial architectures. While the independent thread issue causes extra overhead in the fetch and issue parts of the pipeline, the number of computation resources required can be reduced through the sharing of less frequently used execution units. Furthermore, since all the threads run a single program on multiple data (SPMD), thread processors can share instruction and data caches. Ray tracing needs read-only access to the scene data during each frame, so caches can be optimized for reading, and traditional cache coherence protocols are unnecessary for maintaining coherent memory access. The resultant image exists as a write only frame buffer, allowing memory writes to avoid the cache entirely, preventing cache pollution and increasing the performance of smaller caches.
        Commercial real-time rendering systems lean heavily on high-performance graphics processing units (GPU) that use the rasterization and z-buffer algorithms for rendering. A single pass of rasterization throws out much of the global scene information by streaming the surface data that a ray tracer keeps resident in memory. As a result, ray tracing is more naturally able to support rendering effects involving global information, such as shadows, reflections, refractions and camera lens effects. Rasterization has a time complexity of approximately O(Nlog(P)) where N is the number of primitive polygons and P is the number of pixels in the image. Ray tracing, in contrast, has a time complexity of O(Plog(N)) making ray tracing scale better to large scenes with many primitive polygons, allowing for increased surface detail. Finally, once the number of pixels reaches its limit, ray tracing should exceed the performance of rasterization by allowing the number of objects to increase with less of a penalty on performance."

        abstract: "The disclosure provides features or schemes that improve a user's experience with an interactive computer product by reducing latency through late latching and late warping. The late warping can be applied by imaging hardware based on late latch inputs and is applicable for both local and cloud computing environments. In one aspect, the disclosure provides a method of operating an imaging system employing late latching and late warping. In one example the method of operating an imaging system includes: (1) rendering a rendered image based on a user input from an input device and scene data from an application engine, (2) obtaining a late latch input from the input device, (3) rendering, employing imaging hardware, a warped image by late warping at least a portion of the rendered image based on the late latch input, and (4) updating state information in the application engine with late latch and warp information."

        abstract: "Perceived clarity of an image presented by a display can be improved using an image stabilization technique to stabilize the image relative to a user's retina. During an illumination period, stabilization actuators are controlled to move a display panel or adjust optical components in the path of light associated with the image to shift the location of the image on the user's retina in response to head or eye movement detected by the system. In some embodiments, a display is configured to illuminate an image, and at least one stabilization actuator is configured to stabilize the image in a retina space associated with a user. Changes in the retina space can be detected by one or more sensors configured to detect a head position of the user and/or an orientation of the user's retina. The image is stabilized in retina space using the stabilization actuators."

        abstract: "Deep-learning-based algorithms have led to impressive results in visual-saliency prediction, but the impact of noise in training gaze data has been largely overlooked. This issue is especially relevant for videos, where the gaze data tends to be incomplete, and thus noisier, compared to images. Therefore, we propose a noise-aware training (NAT) paradigm for visual-saliency prediction that quantifies the uncertainty arising from gaze data incompleteness and inaccuracy, and accounts for it in training. We demonstrate the advantage of NAT independently of the adopted model architecture, loss function, or training dataset. Given its robustness to the noise in incomplete training datasets, NAT ushers in the possibility of designing gaze datasets with fewer human subjects. We also introduce the first dataset that offers a video-game context for video-saliency research, with rich temporal semantics, and multiple gaze attractors per frame."

We developed these extensions in the process of incorporating the previous work into the global illumination solutions of the NVIDIA RTXGI SDK, the Unity and Unreal Engine 4 game engines, and proprietary engines for several commercial games. These extensions include: a single, intuitive tuning parameter (the 'self-shadow' bias); heuristics to speed transitions in the global illumination; reuse of irradiance data as prefiltered radiance for recursive glossy reflection; a probe state machine to prune work that will not affect the final image; and multiresolution cascaded volumes for large worlds."

        abstract: "Emergent in the field of head mounted display design is a desire to leverage the limitations of the human visual system to reduce the computation, communication, and display workload in power and form-factor constrained systems. Fundamental to this reduced workload is the ability to match display resolution to the acuity of the human visual system, along with a resulting need to follow the gaze of the eye as it moves, a process referred to as foveation. A display that moves its content along with the eye may be called a Foveated Display, though this term is also commonly used to describe displays with non-uniform resolution that attempt to mimic human visual acuity. We therefore recommend a definition for the term Foveated Display that accepts both of these interpretations. Furthermore, we include a simplified model for human visual Acuity Distribution Functions (ADFs) at various levels of visual acuity, across wide fields of view and propose comparison of this ADF with the Resolution Distribution Function of a foveated display for evaluation of its resolution at a particular gaze direction. We also provide a taxonomy to allow the field to meaningfully compare and contrast various aspects of foveated displays in a display and optical technology-agnostic manner."

        abstract: "SimTRaX is a simulation infrastructure for simultaneous exploration of highly parallel accelerator architectures and how applications map to them. The infrastructure targets both cycle-accurate and functional simulation of architectures with thousands of simple cores that may share expensive computation and memory resources. A modified LLVM backend used to compile C++ programs for the simulated architecture allows the user to create custom instructions that access proposed special-purpose hardware and to debug and profile the applications being executed. The simulator models a full memory hierarchy including registers, local scratchpad RAM, shared caches, external memory channels, and DRAM main memory, leveraging the USIMM DRAM simulator to provide accurate dynamic latencies and power usage. SimTRaX provides a powerful and flexible infrastructure for exploring a class of extremely parallel architectures for parallel applications that are not easily simulated using existing simulators."

An experiment designer can control a variety of parameters including target motion, weapon configuration, 3D scene, frame rate, and latency. Furthermore, we validate this application through careful end-to-end latency analysis and provide a case study showing how it can be used to demonstrate the training effect of one user given repeated task performance."

        abstract: "In the world of esports (competitive video games), hardware and software configurations are optimized for winning. In many games this means minimizing latency ('I see you before you see me') and maximizing refresh rate ('I see your move more accurately'). Most esports athletes and competitive players ensure this by using high-end hardware (computers, monitors, and GPUs) while turning off superfluous in-game graphics features. By doing so, one can demonstrate the competitive benefit of modern display technologies. We conducted two user studies that compare esports performance using common display settings. We conclude that 240 hz, today's highest-speed display technology, provides a competitive advantage."

        abstract: TRaX (Threaded Ray eXecution) is a highly parallel multi-threaded, multi-core processor architecture designed for real-time ray tracing. One motivation behind TRaX is to accelerate single-ray performance instead of relying on ray-packets in SIMD mode to boost throughput, which can fail as packets become incoherent. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach we implement a path tracer on the TRaX simulator and measure performance as the secondary rays become less coherent. We are able to show that TRaX exhibits only minor slowdown on highly incoherent rays compared to a well-optimized SIMD-packet based path tracer which suffers significant slowdown as rays become incoherent.
