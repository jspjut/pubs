        title: Hybrid Modulation for Near Zero Display Latency
        conference: Society of Information Display

        abstract: "Binary displays for virtual reality can achieve low latency by integrating view tracking with modulation. We present a novel modulation scheme that combines tracking, pulse density modulation, and pulse width modulation to minimize grayscale artifacts. The hybrid modulator is applied to an AMOLED display at an update rate of 1.7 kHz on which we observe nearly zero latency in the perceived image."

        abstract: Augmented reality (AR) has recently gained momentum in the form of a variety of available optical see-through near-eye displays (NEDs) such as the Meta 2and the Microsoft Hololens. These devices are a big step forward towards Sutherland's vision of an ultimate display [Sutherland 1968]. The device we demonstrate attempts to deal with the main limitations of current devices. First, the graphics images are at a constant virtual distance for the eyes' accommodation mechanism, while the vergence of the two eyes working in concert places the virtual object(s) at a distance other than the accommodation distance. This vergence-accommodation conflict is one of the main problems in many AR and VR systems [Kress and Starner 2013]. The second limitation is achieving a wide FOV with compact optics. Cakmakci et al. [2006] contend that achieving a wide field-of-view (FOV) is the major optical design challenge in AR NEDs.

        abstract: "This dissertation presents computer architecture designs that are efficient for ray tracing based rendering algorithms. The primary observation is that ray tracing maps better to independent thread issue hardware designs than it does to dependent thread and data designs used in most commercial architectures. While the independent thread issue causes extra overhead in the fetch and issue parts of the pipeline, the number of computation resources required can be reduced through the sharing of less frequently used execution units. Furthermore, since all the threads run a single program on multiple data (SPMD), thread processors can share instruction and data caches. Ray tracing needs read-only access to the scene data during each frame, so caches can be optimized for reading, and traditional cache coherence protocols are unnecessary for maintaining coherent memory access. The resultant image exists as a write only frame buffer, allowing memory writes to avoid the cache entirely, preventing cache pollution and increasing the performance of smaller caches.
        Commercial real-time rendering systems lean heavily on high-performance graphics processing units (GPU) that use the rasterization and z-buffer algorithms for rendering. A single pass of rasterization throws out much of the global scene information by streaming the surface data that a ray tracer keeps resident in memory. As a result, ray tracing is more naturally able to support rendering effects involving global information, such as shadows, reflections, refractions and camera lens effects. Rasterization has a time complexity of approximately O(Nlog(P)) where N is the number of primitive polygons and P is the number of pixels in the image. Ray tracing, in contrast, has a time complexity of O(Plog(N)) making ray tracing scale better to large scenes with many primitive polygons, allowing for increased surface detail. Finally, once the number of pixels reaches its limit, ray tracing should exceed the performance of rasterization by allowing the number of objects to increase with less of a penalty on performance."

        abstract: TRaX (Threaded Ray eXecution) is a highly parallel multi-threaded, multi-core processor architecture designed for real-time ray tracing. One motivation behind TRaX is to accelerate single-ray performance instead of relying on ray-packets in SIMD mode to boost throughput, which can fail as packets become incoherent. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach we implement a path tracer on the TRaX simulator and measure performance as the secondary rays become less coherent. We are able to show that TRaX exhibits only minor slowdown on highly incoherent rays compared to a well-optimized SIMD-packet based path tracer which suffers significant slowdown as rays become incoherent.
